## Overview

Built on the [Hexo Tag Plugins](https://hexo.io/api/tag) framework and powered by the versatile [Apache ECharts library](https://echarts.apache.org/zh/index.html), this plugin transforms raw blog statistics‚Äîsuch as post frequency, tags, and categories‚Äîinto elegant, interactive charts.

The charts dynamically adapt to your site's theme, switching between `dark mode` and `light mode` based on your browser settings. Whether you're tracking your writing habits or showcasing your blog's activity, this plugin delivers a seamless and engaging experience.

Inspired by [hexo-graph](https://github.com/codepzj/hexo-graph), this plugin offers a fresh take on data visualization for Hexo blogs. If you're looking for alternative solutions, feel free to explore hexo-graph as well!
